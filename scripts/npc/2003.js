	["Here's how to take down a monster. Every monster possesses an HP of its own and you'll take them down by attacking with either a weapon or through spells. Of course the stronger they are, the harder it is to take them down.\r\n\r\n#fUI/DialogImage.img/Help/1#"],
	["This is how you gather up an item. Once you take down a monster, an item will be dropped to the ground. When that happens, stand in front of the item and press #bZ#k or #b0 on the NumPad#k to acquire the item.\r\n\r\n#fUI/DialogImage.img/Help/2#"],

He'll teach you all about becoming a true warrior. Ohh, and one VERY important thing: You'll need to be at least level 10 in order to become a warrior!!"],

Ohh, and one VERY important thing: You'll need to be at least level 10 in order to become a bowman!!"],
	["You want to become a #bThief#k? In order to become one, you'll have to head over to Victoria Island. Head over to a thief-town called #rKerning City#k, and on the shadier side of town, you'll see a thief's hideaway. There, you'll meet #bDark Lord#k who'll teach you everything about being a thief. Ohh, and one VERY important thing: You'll need to be at least level 10 in order to become a thief!!"],

	["You want to know how to check out the items you've picked up, huh? When you defeat a monster, it'll drop an item on the ground, and you may press #bZ#k to pick up the item. That item will then be stored in your item inventory, and you can take a look at it by simply pressing #bI#k."],

You can also put on the item by opening the equipment inventory (#bE#k) and dragging the item into it. To take off an item, double-click on the item at the equipment inventory."],
	["You want to check on the equipped items, right? Press #bE#k to open the equipment inventory, where you'll see exactly what you are wearing right at the moment. To take off an item, double-click on the item. The item will then be sent to the item inventory."],
