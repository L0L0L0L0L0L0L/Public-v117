When you pass through all gateways within the time limit, you will be moved to an area to get prizes! There are #b3 stages#k to the gateways. The time limit is #r6 minutes#k, and after that the game will #bend automatically#k. [Up and Up] #rdoes not allow #bjumps, teleports#k, or #bhastes#k. More details can be provided within the game."],

You cannot use Teleport or Haste in [Physical Fitness Test]."], 
	["#b[Snowball Rollin]#k is a game to see which one of the two teams, 'Maple' and 'Story', #brolls Snowball farther#k. If the victor is not determined during the time given, the team that rolled more distance at the end wins more. \r\n\r\nGo near the Snowball and attack (Ctrl key) to slowly roll the Snowball forward. Ranged attacks and all attack skills are useless - you can ONLY use #rmelee attack#k. \r\n\r\nCharacter that touches the Snowball will instantly be summoned back to the starting point. Attack the Snowman at the starting point to keep the opposing team's Snowball from moving forward. Attack the Snowball or attack the Snowman? Strategize with your team and lead your team to victory!"], 
	["In #b[Coconut Harvest]#k, the participants get divided into two different teams, the Maple and the Story team, and compete against each other. The team that #bpicks up more coconuts within the given time limit#k wins the game. The time limit is #r5 minutes#k. If the first game ends in a [Draw], additional 2 minutes will be added to the game. If two teams tie again, then the game will end in a draw. \r\n\r\nNo range attacks or skills can be used in this game mode. Only the #rmelee attack#k can be used. If you don't have any melee weapons, you can purchase a melee weapon from the NPC located inside of the event map. Regardless of the character level, weapon, or its options, same hit damage will be applied. \r\n\r\nAlso you'll find obstacles and traps in various locations in the map. You will be dropped out of the event game when your character dies. The last player to hit the coconut before it falls on the ground will gain the point. Only the fallen coconut will be counted towards your points. There are hidden portals in the turban sheel at the bottom of the map, so try to take advantage of these hidden portals!"],
